# Bible Notes — Complete Implementation Instructions

---

## About These Instructions

**What you're receiving:**
- Finished UI designs (React components with full styling)
- Data model definitions (TypeScript types and sample data)
- UI/UX specifications (user flows, requirements, screenshots)
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Test-writing instructions for each section (for TDD approach)

**What you need to build:**
- Backend API endpoints and database schema
- Authentication and authorization
- Data fetching and state management
- Business logic and validation
- Integration of the provided UI components with real data

**Important guidelines:**
- **DO NOT** redesign or restyle the provided components — use them as-is
- **DO** wire up the callback props to your routing and API calls
- **DO** replace sample data with real data from your backend
- **DO** implement proper error handling and loading states
- **DO** implement empty states when no records exist (first-time users, after deletions)
- **DO** use test-driven development — write tests first using `tests.md` instructions
- The components are props-based and ready to integrate — focus on the backend and data layer
