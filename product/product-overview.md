# Mounjapp

## Description
Mounjapp is a GLP-1 companion app built to maximize the ROI of costly medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro by guiding users through dosing cycles, protein-first nutrition, and proactive side-effect mitigation. It keeps users on track with tailored routines synced to injection days so they lose weight while protecting lean mass and comfort.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: High treatment cost with uncertain outcomes
Users invest heavily in GLP-1 drugs but may not follow an optimized protocol, risking stalled progress and churn. Mounjapp runs a deep diagnostic quiz, generates a personalized plan, and projects weight loss timelines to justify ongoing use and adherence.

### Problem 2: Loss of lean mass and aesthetic downsides
Calorie-focused trackers overlook the protein and fiber emphasis needed to avoid "Ozempic Face" and flaccidity. Mounjapp elevates protein targets on the dashboard, nudges hydration and fiber intake, and keeps routines synchronized to the injection cycle to protect muscle and appearance.

### Problem 3: Gastrointestinal side effects and dosing friction
Poor site rotation, dose changes, and untracked symptoms can trigger nausea, constipation, or fatigue. Mounjapp tracks injections with site history and smart reminders, logs dosage adjustments, and pairs the symptom diary with cycle-aware insights like increasing fiber before known trigger days.

## Key Features
- Diagnostic quiz capturing medication, dosage, injection day, and side effects to generate a personalized plan and hook the paywall.
- Weight projection curve that visualizes when the user is likely to reach their goal based on current inputs.
- Injection cycle tracker with application logging, site rotation, smart reminders, and dose history.
- Protein-first nutrition monitoring with hydration and fiber widgets plus fast food scanning via label or photo to log macros.
- Symptom and side-effect diary with cycle-based correlations that translate patterns into actionable guidance.
- Gamified bento-style dashboard with progress photos and a Tamagotchi-like buddy that evolves with consistency.
